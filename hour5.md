### Capstone Project: Design Your Personal AI Operating System

This final hour brings everything together into a practical, personalized framework you'll use daily.

### Part 1: Strategic Self-Assessment

#### Your Unique Value Inventory

**List Your Assets:**

1. **Experiences Others Don't Have**
   - Cultural background
   - Challenges overcome
   - Communities you belong to
   - Places you've lived/worked

2. **Skills That Required Human Development**
   - Relationships you've built
   - Trust you've earned
   - Problems you've solved creatively
   - Times you've led through uncertainty

3. **Knowledge That's Contextual**
   - Understanding of your community

4. **Natural Abilities**
   - What comes easily to you?
   - What do others ask your help with?
   - When do you lose track of time?
   - What energizes rather than drains you?

#### Your Growth Edges

Identify areas where AI could help you grow:
- Skills you want but lack time to develop
- Information you need but struggle to organize
- Tasks that drain energy from important work
- Areas where you need confidence building

### Part 2: Creating Your AI Boundaries

#### The Decision Framework

For any task, ask these four questions:

1. **Will using AI here help me grow or keep me dependent?**
   - Growth: Use AI
   - Dependency: Do it yourself

2. **Is this core to my identity/values or peripheral?**
   - Core: Maintain human control
   - Peripheral: Consider AI assistance

3. **Will I learn something important by doing this myself?**
   - Yes: Do it yourself
   - No: Consider AI help

4. **Does this require my unique perspective/experience?**
   - Yes: Lead with human insight
   - No: AI can assist

#### Your Personal Boundaries

Complete these statements:

**I will ALWAYS maintain human control over:**
- Example: Personal communications with loved ones
- Example: Decisions affecting my community
- Your additions: _______________

**I will STRATEGICALLY use AI for:**

- Example: Grammar and formatting checks
- Your additions: _______________

**I will NEVER use AI for:**
- Example: Expressing my personal beliefs
- Example: Creative work I want to own

### Part 3: Your Development Plan

#### 30-Day Skill Building Challenge

Choose one AI-resistant skill to develop:

**Week 1: Foundation**

- Plan continued development

#### Your Learning Stack

Design how you'll combine human and AI learning:

**For New Technical Skills:**
1. Human: Understand core concepts
2. AI: Generate practice problems
3. Human: Work through problems
4. AI: Check understanding
5. Human: Apply to real project

**For Creative Development:**
1. Human: Generate original ideas
2. AI: Research techniques/methods
3. Human: Create first draft
4. AI: Suggest technical improvements
5. Human: Refine with personal style

**For Professional Growth:**
1. Human: Identify growth areas
2. AI: Curate learning resources
3. Human: Practice with real scenarios
4. AI: Simulate challenging situations
5. Human: Reflect and integrate

### Part 4: Implementation Strategies

4. How did my unique perspective add value?

#### Monthly Evolution

**Adjust Your System:**
